# 🚀 SimCity-Sub-Zero Prototype: City-Building Adventure 🌆

Welcome to the SimCity-Sub-Zero Prototype, an exciting journey into the mechanics of building a city in this early-stage simulation game! 🌟 As a part of my Semester 3 coursework, I'm delving into the dynamic world of city development using Java.

## Key Features:

- **City Evolution:** Witness the growth of your city with basic population dynamics, economic rudiments, and preliminary infrastructure development.
- **Resource Experimentation:** Delve into the foundational aspects of resource allocation, trying to strike a balance between citizen needs and the city's expansion aspirations.
- **Interactive Elements:** Engage with simulated inhabitants, address initial concerns, maintain all your infrastructure and make rudimentary decisions to steer the trajectory of your budding metropolis.
- **Code Exploration:** Dive into the early stages of Java programming as you explore a developing and modular codebase behind the SimCity-Sub-Zero Prototype.

## Why SimCity-Sub-Zero Prototype?

- 🌇 **Shape Your Mini-City:** Experiment with constructing your city, starting from basic structures to envisioning a modest urban landscape.
- 🧠 **Learn Through Play:** SimCity-Sub-Zero Prototype is not just a game; it's a learning experience, offering insights into Java development, software design, and the fundamentals of game mechanics.
- 🤝 **Early Collaboration:** Contribute to the growth of the SimCity-Sub-Zero Prototype by exploring, suggesting improvements, or even crafting your own early features. Let's lay the foundation of this city together!

## Get Started:

1. Clone the evolving prototype: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SimCity-Sub-Zero-Prototype.git`
2. Dive into the codebase, experiment with emerging game mechanics, and be a part of shaping the SimCity-Sub-Zero Prototype.

Embark on this simulation adventure, and let's lay the groundwork for the ultimate city-building experience! 🌃🛠️
